Python interpreter: An environment that we can use to execute python commands
without a graphical user interface
-> can use Terminal@Mac as Python interpreter
Input following in Terminal: python3, can open Python interpreter
Examples:
1. print("Hello World")
2. num1 = 10
   num2 = 90
   print(num1 + num2)
3. def say_hi(name):
      print("Hello " + name);
   say_hi("Mike")
