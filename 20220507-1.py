#HW18 While loop
#allow us to loop though and execute a block of code multiple times
i = 1
while i <=10:  #condition i ＝ raise by Japanese 
    print(i)
    i += 1

print("Don't with loop")

#1. check the condition first time
#2. loop though all the code
#3. go back up to the top and check it again
#4. once the condition is not true, then come out from while loop
